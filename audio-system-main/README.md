# Audio System package

## How to use
The main script of the package is the `AudioManager.cs` script. It is a singleton and can be accessed from anywhere in the project.
It provides all the API methods you need for various sound playing. You just need to specify the maximum number of clips at the time
and the Audio Mixer (Right click > Create > Audio Mixer).
